# Morris-In-order-Traversal-In-Binary-Tree
The code implements Morris Traversal, an elegant algorithm for performing an inorder traversal of a binary tree without using recursion or an explicit stack. It achieves a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) by temporarily modifying the tree structure.
